- Developed a cotton plant disease detection system using ResNet-50, VGG16, and VGG19, achieving a 25% increase
in detection accuracy.Curated and preprocessed a diverse dataset of cotton plant images, enhancing model training
and robustness.
- Fine-tuned pre-trained models using transfer learning, optimizing their performance for plant disease
identification.Conducted thorough evaluation of model performance, selecting the best model based on
comprehensive metrics.
- Deployed the final model into a farmer-friendly application, enabling real-time disease diagnosis and actionable
insights.Collaborated with agricultural experts to validate the system, ensuring its efficacy in real-world conditions.
