- This project focuses on predicting IMDb movie ratings based on various features such as genre, director, and actors. It utilizes machine learning algorithms for regression tasks to predict movie ratings accurately.
- Random Forest Regression: A Random Forest Regressor is trained on the training data to predict movie ratings. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is calculated to evaluate the model's performance.

- Linear Regression: Another model based on Linear Regression is trained and evaluated using MSE as a metric.
