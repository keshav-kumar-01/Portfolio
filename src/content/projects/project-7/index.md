- Developed a machine learning model for image and text processing using JAX and NumPy. The project involved
creating a custom data iterator and training loop, handling complex data types, and optimizing for performance.
- Implemented the training loop, including batch processing and model optimization.Debugged and resolved issues
related to data types and array sharding.
- Successfully trained the model to process and analyze complex datasets.Optimized the training loop to handle large
batches efficiently.Achieved significant improvements in data processing speed and model accuracy.
